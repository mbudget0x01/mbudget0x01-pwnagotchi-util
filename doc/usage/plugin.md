This is straigth forward. 

1. Put the file ```python/mbudget0x01.py``` in your pwnagotchi custom plugins folder.
2. Put the folder ```python/packages``` in your pwnagotchi custom plugins folder.

If you have specified another address than 10.0.0.2 for your pwnagotchi, you need to specify this in your pwnagotchi config.
